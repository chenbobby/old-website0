## _who dis?_

Hi! I'm Bob Chen.

I'm currently on leave from Harvard, where I was studying applied mathematics and computer science.
COVID-19 has thrown a wrench into a lot of my plans, and I don't know when I'll go back to school.
I still have one more year until I finish my undergrad.
However, I'm not too keen on paying [full tuition](https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/tuition-and-fees) for a year of Zoom University.

So, in the meantime, I'm spending my time baking banana bread, knitting scarves, and _building a column-store database from scratch_.

It's going to take a while.
But these days, I have more than enough time on my hands.
I'll be taking notes and publishing articles about my learnings along the way.

Along with doing independent research and writing, I'm also looking for work!
So, if you want help on a research project or need to fill a role in your team, please reach out.
